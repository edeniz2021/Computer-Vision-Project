Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains a collection of computer vision projects developed using Python programming language. The projects utilize various computer vision libraries such as OpenCV, Mediapipe, NumPy, and more to implement different functionalities.

Projects
1. Virtual Calculator
The Virtual Calculator project implements a calculator interface on the screen using hand tracking. Users can input numbers and perform calculations by pressing the virtual keys displayed on the screen.

2. Virtual Keyboard
The Virtual Keyboard project creates a virtual keyboard on the screen and enables users to type by using hand gestures detected through computer vision techniques.

3. Gesture-based Volume Control
The Gesture-based Volume Control project allows users to increase or decrease the system volume by performing specific hand gestures captured through the camera.

4. Face Detection Program
The Face Detection Program detects and recognizes faces in real-time using computer vision algorithms. It can identify the location and track multiple faces simultaneously.

5. Document Scanner
The Document Scanner project enables users to scan and digitize documents using computer vision techniques. It captures an image of a document, applies perspective transformation, and enhances the scanned output.

Requirements

Python 3.x
OpenCV library 
Mediapipe library 
NumPy library 
Other required libraries (if any)
